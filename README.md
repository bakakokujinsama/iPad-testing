For testing git support on iPad

This edit signifies one thing: I can transfer text I type on my iPad to an online GitHub repository. Used in conjunction with a ssh application, this could mean creating and compiling code on a remote server. Productivity on my iPad May have just taken a very large leap.

While I am busy I would like to discuss an idea I had. I will describe this idea in the form of a scientific procedure so that these steps might be followed and recreated by a capable being.

1. Set up a server.

Requires: a remote server with ssh capabilities. This server should have the computing power to git code and compile.

2. Send code using this file.

Literally, type all code into this README file and save. Then using the ssh application, connect to the server and git pull. Copy the code or deal with whatever is in the README file however is necessary.

This is going to become something very similar to scripting; only using the GitHub app as a text editor and minimizing time on the ssh connection. Overall decent idea, but it's only going to get a 4/10. We'll see how I feel tomorrow to make this official...
